# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025

SimAppsPriority is committed to protecting your privacy. Our website is designed exclusively for parents and adults, while our mobile applications are intended for children and their families. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to safeguard your data.

By using our website or mobile applications (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of our Services immediately.

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time — for example, to reflect changes in our practices, new features, or legal requirements. If we make material changes, we will notify users (where feasible, e.g., via email if provided) and post the updated policy here with a revised "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.

For questions or concerns, please contact us at:

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### a) Information You Provide  
Our apps do not require users to submit personally identifiable information (PII). In rare cases (e.g., for technical support), you may voluntarily provide contact details — but this is not collected by default.

### b) Automatically Collected Data  
When you use our Services, certain non-personal or technical data may be collected automatically via third-party tools, including:

- Device model and operating system version  
- IP address (temporarily logged)  
- App configuration, usage timestamps, and crash/error logs ("Log Data")  
- Unique device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID)

⚠️ **Important:** We do **not** knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that such data has been inadvertently collected, we will delete it promptly.

## 2. Third-Party Services

Our apps integrate trusted third-party SDKs and services, which may collect data as described in their respective privacy policies:

| Service         | Purpose                     | Privacy Policy Link |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Google Play Services | Analytics, authentication | [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| Google AdMob    | Ad serving (contextual only) | [AdMob Policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) |
| Unity Ads       | Ad delivery                 | [Unity Privacy](https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy) |
| AppLovin        | Ad mediation                | [AppLovin Privacy](https://www.applovin.com/privacy/) |

These providers may use cookies, device identifiers, and similar technologies for analytics and advertising. Note: **No personally identifiable information is shared with advertisers**. Ads served in children-directed apps comply with [COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule) and are non-personalized.

## 3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

While our Services do not use first-party cookies, third-party SDKs may deploy cookies or local storage for:
- Analytics (e.g., crash reporting)
- Ad frequency capping
- Performance optimization

You can manage cookie preferences via your device settings. Disabling cookies may limit some app functionality.

## 4. Use of Service Providers

We may engage trusted third parties to:
- Host and maintain our services  
- Analyze app performance and usage  
- Deliver content or support services  

These providers are contractually obligated to:
- Use data only on our behalf  
- Implement appropriate security measures  
- Not retain, use, or disclose data for any other purpose

---

## 5. Data Security

We implement industry-standard security practices (e.g., encryption, access controls) to protect your information. However, no digital transmission or storage system is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 6. Third-Party Links

Our Services may contain links to external websites (e.g., support resources, app stores). We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these sites. Always review their privacy policies before sharing information.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

✅ **We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.**  
✅ Our apps directed to children **do not include behavioral advertising or social features**.  
✅ If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us immediately at **contact@simappspriority.com** — we will remove it without delay.

Parents may also use device-level controls (e.g., Google Play Family Link, iOS Screen Time) to manage app usage.
